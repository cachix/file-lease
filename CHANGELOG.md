# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- Experiment with in-kernel macOS RAM-disk attachment to reduce setup overhead.

- Add optional metadata-only phase profiling for file-lease latency diagnostics,
  including individual macOS file operations.

- Provide process-owned memory-backed files on Linux and macOS with automatic
  cleanup, owner handoff, and recovery of orphaned macOS RAM volumes.
- Maintain file leases independently of SecretSpec, with the same 0.1.0 API.
